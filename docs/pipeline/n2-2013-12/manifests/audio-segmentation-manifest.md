# N2 2013-12 listening segmentation manifest

Status: `needs_review` until clips are uploaded/read back and boundary spot-check is complete.

Source: `source-listening.mp3` (2735.856 s, MP3, 32 kHz stereo).

Evidence:
- Japanese timestamped ASR: `/opt/data/n2_asr.json` (552 segments, full duration) and `/opt/data/n2_asr.log`.
- Acoustic silence detection: `/tmp/n2_silence.txt`, `silencedetect=noise=-32dB:d=0.8`.
- Printed transcript: `ocr/answers-transcript-pages-01-13.md`.
- Boundaries were chosen at silence immediately before the ASR section announcement, not by equal-duration splitting.
