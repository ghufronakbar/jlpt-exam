# Project-Specific Architecture & Rules

## 1. Tech Stack Summary

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Supabase) via Prisma |
| File storage | Cloudinary (audio/images; DB stores URLs only) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui |
| State | React Context |
| Auth | Custom credential auth: `bcryptjs` + `jose` (JWT in httpOnly cookie) |
| Validation | `zod` (single source of truth for all input schemas) |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers/zod` |

Do NOT introduce other libraries for these concerns (e.g., NextAuth/Auth.js, Redux, axios, styled-components) without explicit approval.

## 2. Modular Folder Structure
* Maintain a modular and feature-driven folder structure.
* Separate global/generic UI building blocks (`./src/components/ui`) from feature-specific logic.
* Group components, hooks, and local state by feature (e.g., inside `./src/features/[feature-name]`) to encapsulate logic and maintain scalability.

## 3. UI Components & shadcn/ui
* **Location:** `./src/components/ui`
* Always check for and utilize existing shadcn/ui components before creating new custom components.
* Prefer utilizing existing hooks from the shadcn ecosystem (e.g., `use-toast`, `use-form`) for standard UI behaviors.
* When extending or overriding shadcn component styles, always use the `cn()` utility to prevent Tailwind class conflicts.

## 4. Authentication & Session
This is a **single-user** app. Auth is intentionally minimal — no OAuth, no roles, no multi-tenant logic.

* **Password hashing:** `bcryptjs` with cost factor 12. Hash on register (first-time setup) and compare with `bcrypt.compare()` on login. NEVER store or log plaintext passwords.
* **Session:** stateless JWT signed with `jose` (HS256, secret from `SESSION_SECRET` env var), stored in an **httpOnly, secure, sameSite=lax** cookie named `session`. Expiry: 7 days. No session table in the database.
* **Session helpers location:** `./src/lib/auth.ts` — `createSession()`, `getSession()`, `destroySession()`. All session reads/writes go through these helpers; never read the cookie manually elsewhere.
* **Route protection:** `src/proxy.ts` (the `middleware.ts` convention was renamed to `proxy.ts` in this Next.js version — see `node_modules/next/dist/docs`) guards all routes except `(auth)` group routes and static assets. No valid session → redirect to `/login`. This is an **optimistic** check only (JWT read from cookie, no DB round-trip); Server Actions that mutate data MUST also verify the session themselves via `getSession()`.
* **Registration lock:** the register action MUST check `count(User) === 0` before creating a user. If a user already exists, reject and redirect — registration is one-time only (see `project-overview.md`).
* **Login safety:** on failed login, return a generic error message ("invalid credentials"), never reveal whether the username exists.

## 5. Input Validation (zod)
* Every Server Action MUST validate its input with a `zod` schema before touching the database. Never trust client data, including "internal" calls.
* Schemas live next to their feature (e.g., `./src/features/exam/schemas.ts`) and are shared between the form (client) and the action (server) — define once, use on both sides.
* Forms use `react-hook-form` with `zodResolver`; do not hand-roll form state for standard forms.

## 6. Server Actions & Caching
* Use Server Actions for both data fetching (`get`) and data mutations (`mutate`).
* **Caching for 'get' actions:** Implement caching for data-fetching Server Actions using Next.js caching mechanisms (such as `unstable_cache` with tags).
* **Centralized Cache Keys:** All cache keys and tags MUST be defined in `./src/constants/cache-key.ts`. Never hardcode cache key strings inside actions. This ensures easy invalidation (e.g., via `revalidateTag`) from a single source of truth.
* **Data leak guard:** actions that serve exam-mode data MUST NOT include `questionAnswer` or `explanation` in their return payload (see `database.md`). Use explicit Prisma `select` — never return full models by default.

## 7. Environment Variables & Constants
* **Location:** `./src/constants/index.ts`
* NEVER access `process.env.YOUR_VARIABLE` directly inside UI components, hooks, or business logic.
* All environment variables and global constants MUST be recalled, validated, and exported from `./src/constants/index.ts`.
* Required env vars: `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`. Validate presence at startup (zod schema in the constants file); fail fast with a clear error if missing.
* NEVER expose server-only secrets to the client (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix on secrets).

## 8. State Management
* **Tool:** React Context.
* Use React Context for shared or global state management within features or the application.
* Isolate context providers to the lowest possible component tree level to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
* **Exam state:** in-progress answers/flags live in a feature-level context and are persisted to `sessionStorage` (survive refresh), committed to DB only on session submit (see `project-overview.md`).

## 9. Styling (Tailwind CSS v4)
* Use Tailwind CSS v4 standard utility classes and rely on the CSS-first configuration approach.
* Respect the CSS variables defined by the shadcn/ui setup for theming and color consistency.

## 10. Database & ORM (Prisma)
* Ensure the Prisma Client is instantiated using a singleton pattern in a dedicated utility file (`./src/lib/prisma.ts`) to prevent exhausting database connections during development hot-reloads.
* Schema rules, Japanese text markup, and query rules are defined in `database.md` — read it before writing any database code.

## 11. Verification & General Guidelines
* **TypeScript:** Use strict typing. Do not use `any`.
* **Build Verification:** Always run `npm run build` after making structural changes or modifying server actions/caching logic to verify the build integrity and catch errors early.
